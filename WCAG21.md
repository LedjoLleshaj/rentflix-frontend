# WCAG21 Rules

All rules are based on the [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref) specification.

Principle 1 – Perceivable: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive:
- Guideline 1.1 – Text Alternatives: Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.
- Guideline 1.3 – Adaptable: Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure
- Guideline 1.4 – Distinguishable: Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.

Principle 2 – Operable: User interface components and navigation must be operable:
- Guideline 2.1 – Keyboard Accessible: Make all functionality available from a keyboard.
- Guideline 2.3 – Seizures and Physical Reactions: Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures or physical reactions.
- Guideline 2.4 – Navigable: Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.

Level A:
  - 1.1.1 Non-text Content: All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose
  - 1.3.1 Info and Relationships: Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text. 
  - 1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence: When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined.
  - 1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics: Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, color, size, visual location, orientation, or sound.
  - 1.4.1 Use of Color: Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.
  - 2.1.1 Keyboard: All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints.
  - 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap: If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a keyboard interface, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away.
  - 2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts: If a keyboard shortcut is implemented in content using only letter (including upper- and lower-case letters), punctuation, number, or symbol characters
  - 2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold: Web pages do not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period, or the flash is below the general flash and red flash thresholds.
  - 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks: A mechanism is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple Web pages (navigation buttons)
  - 2.4.2 Page Titled: Web pages have titles that describe topic or purpose.
  - 2.4.3 Focus Order: If a Web page can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability.
  - 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context): The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone or from the link text together with its programmatically determined link context, except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general.




Level AA:
  - 1.3.4 Orientation: Content does not restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape, unless a specific display orientation is essential.
  - 1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose: The purpose of each input field collecting information about the user can be programmatically
  - 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum): The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1
  - 1.4.4 Resize text: Except for captions and images of text, text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality.
  - (Check) 1.4.10 Reflow: Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions
  - (Check) 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast: The visual presentation of the following have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent color(s)
  - (Check) 1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus: Where receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible and then hidden, the following...
